----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that **Java 25** is installed on your computer.
2. Launch Kong. The chat window will open and display Kong's greeting.
3. Type a command in the input box at the bottom and press **Enter** (or click **Send**) to execute it.
4. Try out some simple commands:
   * `todo read book` : Adds a new to-do task.
   * `deadline return book /by 2026-10-15` : Adds a deadline due on 15 Oct 2026.
   * `list` : Lists all tasks currently in your list.
   * `bye` : Exits the application.
5. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for detailed instructions on each command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> * Words in `<angle brackets>` are parameters to be supplied by the user.  
>   For example, in `todo <description>`, `<description>` can be `read book`.
> * Dates must follow the strict `yyyy-MM-dd` format (e.g., `2026-10-15`). Calendar dates that do not exist (e.g., `2026-02-30`) are rejected.
> * Task descriptions cannot contain the vertical bar `|` character or newline characters.
> * Tasks are automatically ordered **chronologically**: deadlines and events are sorted by date, while undated to-dos appear at the end.
> * Commands taking no arguments (`list`, `bye`) reject extraneous input.
> * Duplicate tasks (identical task type, description, and dates) are automatically rejected to prevent duplicates.

### Automatic data saving and loading

Kong automatically saves your tasks to `data/duke.txt` whenever you add, delete, or change the completion status of a task. The next time you start Kong, it automatically loads your previously saved tasks so you can pick up right where you left off.
